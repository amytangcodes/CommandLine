	<h1>Git Workflow</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Work (code, make changes, add/remove files, etc.)</li>
		<li>Add files to staging area when you’re done a chunk of work. (git add <file>)</li>
		<li>Take a snapshot (git commit -m "a useful commit message here")</li>
		<li>git push to update github.com repository.</li>
		<li>Repeat steps 1-4.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>When using Git, whether through a GUI or command line, there is a specific workflow that is required. Let’s go over the process and some terminology.</p>

	<h2>Working Directory</h2>
		<p>The working directory is the folder that contains all your project files.</p> 
		<p>present working directory<span>pwd</span></p>

	<h2>Create a Repository</h2>
	

	<h2>Staging area/ Adding Updated Files</h2>
		<p>The staging area is where you collect updated files/folders to eventually be saved as a “snapshot” or version of your project files up to the point. Only the files that have been changed need to be staged.</p>
	
		<ul>
			<li class="staging">Add/stage a specific file <span>git add file-name</span> </li> 
			<li class="staging">Add/stage all new, modified and deleted files<span>git add -A</span></li> 
			<li class="staging">Add/stage new and modified, without deleted<span>git add .</span> </li> 
			<li class="staging">Add/stages modified and deleted, without new<span>git add -u</span> </li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Commit your changes</h2>
		<p>Commit your changes and updates to take the snapshot of your project. Every commit should contain a short message to summarize the changes being committed. (-m stands for message)</p>
		<p>For your first commit, it’s common for your message to be “initial commit”.</p>
		<p><span>git commit -m "a useful commit message here"</span></p>
	
	<h2>Git Status</h2>
		<p>To see which files are in the working directory and which are in the staging area or just to what’s going on in general, use git status. You can use this command at any step to check the status.</p>
		<p><span>git status</span></p>

	<h2>Git Push</h2>
		<p>Note that all these steps are still happening locally on your computer. Your repository that is hosted online via github.com has not changed yet. We need to push the code to get it go up into the repository.</p>
		<p><span>git push origin master</span></p>
